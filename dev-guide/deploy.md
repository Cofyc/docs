## Before you begin

You need to check the [supported platforms](/dev-guide/requirements.md#supported-platforms) and [prerequisites](/dev-guide/requirements.md#prerequisites) first.

## Build and install TiDB components

You can use the [update script](/scripts/update.sh) to update all the TiDB components to the latest version.
